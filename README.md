# A-Level-NEA


This project was done for my Computer Science A-level, in 2017. The main difficulty was navigating UWP, the first time I'd had to work with a huge third-party interface. There are parts of the project that I'm not exceptionally proud of, either because they're slightly dirty or because they appear inefficient, but I was very new to Windows programming and of course had to get the project completed to a schedule.
